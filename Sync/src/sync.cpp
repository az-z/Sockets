This is an example sketch that controls "Etekcity ZAP 5LX
Remote Outlets" with a 434MHz RF Transmitter and Arduino
You can pick up a set of outlets here:

                         Sync Sketch
  This sketch will link an outlet to a particular channel

  - Change the CHANNEL value to the channel you'd like to sync your outlet to
  - Plug your Etekcity outlet into a wall outlet, and hold down the sync
    button until the red LED on the outlet begins to blink continuously
  - While the LED is still blinking, run this sketch on an arduino
    hooked up to a 434MHz transmitter (circuit described in README.md)

  If the outlet was synced correctly, after about 5 seconds (at most)
  you should see your outlet toggle on and off repeatedly.

  Your outlet is now set to be controlled on the specified channel!

#include <Arduino.h>

Outlet outlet(DATA_PIN); //  make a new outlet instance with
// const int CHANNEL_MAX = 10; // max range of channels
const int CHANNEL_MAX = 2; // max range of channels
const bool ON = true;
const bool OFF = false;

const int CHANNEL = 2;  // change this to the channel you'd like to
                        //  sync your outlet to (1-10)
